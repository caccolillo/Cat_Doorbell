Vivado 2020.2 project with only the PS.

To be created as per guideline in:

https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI-Tutorials/tree/2.0/Tutorials/Vitis-AI-Vivado-TRD

this hasn't workes with 2022.2 tools, as the DPU used is older.
Followed the tutorial in the docs folder instead.
The DPU project and the IP core, has been found at:

https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=DPUCZDX8G_VAI_v3.0.tar.gz

download it and extract the archive.
Then replace the trd_prj.tcl with the one in this repo and follow the tutorial.
